EyeCu generates a new, complex, symmetrical pattern every time it runs. The sketch is set up with a canvas size of 1600x800 pixels, and it uses degrees for angle measurements. The draw function, which executes continuously, limits the frame rate to 1.6 frames per second, making the pattern update less than twice per second for a slow, visible transition.

The background is set to a light grey color (220). The sketch then translates the origin point to the center of the canvas to ensure that the symmetrical pattern radiates out from the center.

Symmetry is achieved through a random selection of how many times a set of shapes (a circle, a rectangle, and a line) is drawn and rotated around the center. The number of repetitions (symmetry) is determined by a random value up to 400, creating a wide range of possible patterns. For each repetition, the shapes are rotated by an equal fraction of 360 degrees, ensuring even spacing around the circle.

The shapes include:

A circle with a dynamic stroke color (light purple to pink, with random variations) and a varying size for the height, placed 50 pixels from the center.
A white rectangle placed next to the circle.
A black line extending outward from the center, creating a radial effect.
Overall, this code generates a mesmerizing, kaleidoscopic effect with each execution, producing unique, symmetrical patterns composed of circles, rectangles, and lines in varying colors and sizes.
